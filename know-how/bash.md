# All around the shell
## Initialization
Use .bashrc or .bash_profile, see https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/129143/what-is-the-purpose-of-bashrc-and-how-does-it-work
## Or use some existing work

## Nice command line tricks
Ctrl+r -> Search in history and execute
Ctrl+l -> Clear terminal (scroll down)
!! -> expands to the last command
! + command -> expands to same command you used last time (e.g. !vim opens last file opened in vim)
Or use !$ for last argument
find & grep
Use pipes: >
cd - -> change to the folder you were in before
Ctrl+z -> Susped (pause) program, get to shell
bg -> show supsended guy
fg -> go back to suspended guy
